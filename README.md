a convolutional neural network for text based on "A Sensitivity Analysis of (and Practitionersâ€™ Guide to) Convolutional
Neural Networks for Sentence Classification" and "Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification"

## Datasets

The polarity and subjectivity datasets by Pang/Lee were used to train the model

## Word2vec
